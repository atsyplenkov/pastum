# Acknowledgements
This extension was inspired by the [`{datapasta}`](https://github.com/milesmcbain/datapasta/) R package created by [@MilesMcBain](https://github.com/MilesMcBain) and contributors. However, the implementation in the Code OSS environment was influenced by [@coatless](https://github.com/coatless) and his [web app](https://web-apps.thecoatlessprofessor.com/data/html-table-to-dataframe-tool.html).
